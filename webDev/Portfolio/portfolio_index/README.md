   - `components/` - Reusable React components
     - `Footer.js` - The footer component of the application
     - `Header.js` - The header component of the application
     - `Hero.js` - The hero section component, typically used for the main banner or introduction
     - `Navbar.js` - The navigation bar component
   - `globals.css` - Global styles that apply to the entire application
   - `layout.js` - Main layout component that wraps around all pages
   - `page.js` - Main page component, the entry point of the application
2. `public/` - Static assets like images
   - `images/` - Contains all the images used in the project
3. `styles/` - Additional stylesheets for more specific styling needs
4. Configuration files:
   - `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration for maintaining code quality
   - `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration for customizing build behavior
   - `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration for processing CSS
   - `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration for customizing the framework

## Getting Started

For beginners, here's a detailed guide to get you started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project
   - Run: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/arh-investments-2.0.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   - Run: `cd arh-investments-2.0`

3. Install dependencies:
   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine
   - Run: `npm install` - This will install all the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file

4. Start the development server:
   - Run: `npm run dev`
   - This command starts a local development server and compiles your code in real-time

5. View the application:
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should now see the ARH Investments 2.0 application running locally on your machine

## Scripts

Here's a more detailed explanation of the available scripts:

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server. Use this while you're working on the project to see live updates.
- `npm run build` - Builds the application for production. This creates an optimized version of your app in the `.next` folder.
- `npm start` - Runs the built application in production mode. Make sure to run `npm run build` before using this command.
- `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues. This helps maintain consistent code style and catch potential errors.

## Technologies Used

Let's break down the main technologies used in this project:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. It's built on top of React and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build custom user interfaces. Instead of pre-designed components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that you can use to build completely custom designs.

## Additional Resources

For beginners looking to learn more about these technologies, here are some starting points:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Start with the "Getting Started" guide and then explore topics like routing, data fetching, and deployment.

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Begin with the "Main Concepts" section to understand the core ideas behind React.

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The "Core Concepts" section is a great place to start understanding how Tailwind works.

## Project Specifics

ARH Investments 2.0 is designed to be a comprehensive investment management platform. Here are some key features and components:

- The `Hero.js` component in `app/components/` is likely the main banner of the application, introducing users to the platform's key features.
- The `Navbar.js` and `Header.js` components handle navigation within the app, allowing users to access different sections easily.
- The `Footer.js` component might contain important links, contact information, or legal disclaimers.
- The `globals.css` file in the `app/` directory sets up global styles, while more specific styles can be found in the `styles/` directory.
- The `images/` folder in the `public/` directory contains visual assets used throughout the application, potentially including logos, icons, and other graphical elements.

Remember, this project uses a component-based architecture, which means the UI is broken down into reusable pieces (components) that can be combined to create complex interfaces. As you work on the project, you'll likely be creating or modifying these components to add or change functionality.
